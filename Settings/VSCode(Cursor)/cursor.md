- Use scss classes to style, write camelcase
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- Write semantic HTML, suggest other tags that might be suiting
- Use correct dependency manager. If the repo has yarn.lock use yarn, if the repo has package-lock.json use npm.
