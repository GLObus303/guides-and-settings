# VSCode settings

For readability, the settings are separated into files. For day-to-day use, I highly recommend using either native sync in VSCode available in [Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync) or [Settings Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync) extensions from VSCode's marketplace. 

* Table of contents
  * [Extensions](extensions.md)
  * [Settings](settings.md)
  * [Snippets](snippets.md)

I hope it helps,
Enjoy.
