# VSCode settings

For readability, the settings are separated into files. For day-to-day use, I highly recommend using either native sync in VSCode available in [Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync) or [Settings Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync) extensions from VSCode's marketplace.

This will be separated into three sections. Feel free to use any of them.

- Table of contents
  - Settings
    - VSCode
      - [Extensions](Settings/VSCode/extensions.md)
      - [Settings](Settings/VSCode/settings.md)
      - [Snippets](Settings/VSCode/snippets.md)
    - [Hyper](Settings/hyper.md)
  - Guides
    - [Git flow](Guide/gitFlow.md)
    - [Bug reporting](Guide/bugReport.md)
    - [Links/tools](Guide/links.md)
  - Setup
    - [Eslint](Setup/.eslintrc)

I hope it helps,
Enjoy.
