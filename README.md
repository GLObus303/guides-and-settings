# VSCode settings

For readability, the settings are separated into files. For day-to-day use, I highly recommend using either native sync in VSCode available in [Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync) or [Settings Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync) extensions from VSCode's marketplace. 

This will be separated into two sections - the VSCode part and the guide part. Feel free to use any of them.

* Table of contents
  * VSCode
    * [Extensions](extensions.md)
    * [Settings](settings.md)
    * [Snippets](snippets.md)
  * Guides
    * [Git flow](gitFlow.md)
    * [Bug reporting](bugReport.md)


I hope it helps,
Enjoy.
